I don't have the original content of the Survey.tsx file, so I can't replace the placeholders with the actual code. The AI's response only included a partial fix for some JSX closing tags without showing the full file content.

To properly help you, I would need to see the original Survey.tsx file content. Without that information, I cannot generate a complete file that would be safe to copy and paste into your codebase.

If you can share the original Survey.tsx file, I'll be able to incorporate the AI's suggested fixes while preserving all the existing code.
